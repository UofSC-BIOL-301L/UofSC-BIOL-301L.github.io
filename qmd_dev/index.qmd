title: "301L Additional Material"
---

This site hosts additional material for the 301L at University of South Carolina. All necessary course informaiton will be posted in Blackboard. That is where student will find the worksheet, lab material, and any submission links. This site offers additional material which can supplement informaiton in lab.\n\n

While there are no necessary items, I post material here which can help explain concepts further. Please take some time to look around here. If you find this a useful resource, let me know so I keep motivated to update it!
